2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net exp_iobuf_p[0].i_iobufp/O is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): exp_iobuf_p[0].i_iobufp/IBUF/O
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net exp_iobuf_p[1].i_iobufp/O is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): exp_iobuf_p[1].i_iobufp/IBUF/O
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#3 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net exp_iobuf_p[4].i_iobufp/O is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): exp_iobuf_p[4].i_iobufp/IBUF/O
